## Measure trackers

(Lightbeam for Firefox)[https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/lightbeam/]

Lightbeam is a Firefox add-on. With visualizations it shows you first and third party sites that are called upon while browsing the web. Great for displaying trackers and learning who is related to one or multiple websites.
